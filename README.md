# Setting up a new Data Science Development Environment

I recently needed to set up my development environment on a new computer after not having done so in some time and wanted
to save the steps I followed here for the next time I need to set up a new machine. I used 
[this walkthrough](https://engineeringfordatascience.com/posts/setting_up_a_macbook_for_data_science/) 
with some modifications based on my own preferences.

## Terminal Setup
I prefer to use the old-school default terminal, but with a bunch of custom modifications for things like coloring the
prompt, dynamically displaying and coloring the git branch according to status, and adding new lines so that it's easier
to parse through outputs and commands.

The `.bash_profile` file contains my old preferences for terminal setup, which I've translated for using `zshell` in the
`.zshrc` file, since that is now the standard terminal on modern Macs.

1. Check if there is already a `.zshrc` file created on your machine by typing `open ~.zshrc` in the terminal
2. If you receive an error that the file does not exist, create it with the command `touch ~.zshrc` and then use the
`open ~.zshrc` command again to open it
3. Add whatever styling you like. In my case, lines 1 through 17 in my `.zshrc` file are all for styling in the terminal
4. Save and close the `.zshrc` file and restart the terminal to see the changes reflected

This is what my terminal looks like in a git directory with unstaged changes on a branch called `readme`.

## Install a System Package Manager
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the most popular package manager for MacOS, using this command from the terminal:
```commandline
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Following installation, you may see some prompts to add Homebrew to your `PATH` variable.
Follow the prompts and this will allow you to use the `brew` command to install packages.

## Setup Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is your version control system, but you possibly already know that since you're reading this on GitHub. 
Install git using Homebrew with the command:
```commandline
brew install git
```
Once installed, setup your global identity with your own name and email:
```commandline
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```
You can also set up other defaults such as your preferred text editor. See the documentation for [First-Time Git Setup](
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

You will likely also want to set up a remote connection from your machine to your GitHub account using an SSH key.
Follow the instructions in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
to check for an existing SSH key, generate a new one, and add the key to your machine.

## Setup Python and Virtual Environments

Python comes pre-installed on Macs, but using your machine's system version of python can get incredibly messy,and potentially
dangerous, so it's better not to touch the system version of python at all. Don't upgrade the python version, don't install 
packages, just create virtual environments instead. It's so much cleaner and will also save you headaches if you have old 
projects and newer projects that have clashing version requirements for specific packages.

### Install and set up `pyenv`

You can install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#homebrew-in-macos) with Homebrew.
```commandline
brew install pyenv
```
Then [set up the shell environment for pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv).
For zshell that looks like this:
```commandline
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
So the lines of code in my `.zshrc` file were added with these lines of code after installation.

### Using `pyenv`

You can check the versions of python installed on your machine with the command
```commandline
# list available python versions
pyenv versions
```
Running this will likely show you only the system version of python installed, which we shouldn't touch.
To install an additional version of python, you can run a command like this:
```commandline
# install separate python version 3.12.0
pyenv install 3.12.0

# list versions again
pyenv versions
```
I'm using version 3.12.0 here because it's one of the most recent versions at the time that I'm writing this, but if you 
need to install a different version, you can find the supported releases in the [python version documentation](
https://www.python.org/doc/versions/).

Now lets change the global version of python for our machine to the newly installed version, rather than the system version.
```commandline
# set default version to newly installed 3.12.0
pyenv global 3.12.0

# list versions again
pyenv versions
```

Now you should see a star next to the newly installed version rather than the system version, indicating that it's the default.

### Install `pyenv-virtualenv` for Virtual Environment Management

You can use `venv` which is built into `pyenv`, but I prefer `virtualenv` for managing virtual environments.

```commandline
# install pyenv-virtualenv plugin
brew install pyenv-virtualenv

# add a new line to your to .zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Using `pyenv-virtualenv`

Now you can navigate to a project, create a virtual environment, and activate it. When you want to change to a different 
environment or you're done working on the project, deactivate your virtual environment. It's still there, it's just not active.

Here I'm creating a virtual environment called `ds_env`, but ideally you will want to create a separate environment for
each unique project.

```commandline
# create a new virtualenv (e.g. pyenv virtualenv <python-version> <env-name>)
pyenv virtualenv 3.12.0 ds_env

# activate the virtualenv
pyenv activate ds_env

# list all available virtual environments
pyenv virtualenvs

# deactivate the virtualenv
pyenv deactivate ds_env
```

# Your Data Science Workflow

For each unique data science project, you can now follow this workflow:
1. Create a new GitHub directory
2. Clone the repo to your machine
3. Navigate to the directory and create a virtual environment
4. Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory and add any dependent python packages
5. Install the required packages to your virtual environment with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Conduct your analysis or development in the repo
7. Commit and push to GitHub once your code is complete
8. Deactivate your virtual environment

Saving this info here so that the next time I need to set up a new machine, it will be easy and fast ðŸš€
