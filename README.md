# Setup Files

My profile preference files for setting up a new computer

* `.bash_profile` - an old version of my bash preferences
* `.zshrc` - a new version of my preferences for zshell

# Setup Environment

I followed [this walkthrough](https://engineeringfordatascience.com/posts/setting_up_a_macbook_for_data_science/) 
to set up my environment with a few modifications:

* I prefer to use the old-fashioned terminal with my own customizations, as noted in the setup files
* For my IDE I'm using PyCharm

Saving this info here for the next time I need to set up a new machine.
